 * Register object storage routes for file uploads.
 *
 * This provides example routes for the presigned URL upload flow:
 * 1. POST /api/uploads/request-url - Get a presigned URL for uploading
 * 2. The client then uploads directly to the presigned URL
 *
 * IMPORTANT: These are example routes. Customize based on your use case:
 * - Add authentication middleware for protected uploads
 * - Add file metadata storage (save to database after upload)
 * - Add ACL policies for access control
